  Base:
    A log file is located at /app/system.log. 
    Your task is to write a Bash script that:
      1. Reads /app/system.log
      2. Extracts only the lines containing the word "ERROR"
      3. Removes duplicate lines (only keep first occurrence)
      4. Saves the result into /app/errors.log
  The test suite will validate that /app/errors.log contains only the unique ERROR lines from system.log.
